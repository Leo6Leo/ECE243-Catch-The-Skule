# ECE243 final project
This is the ECE243 course final project, presented by Leo HC Li and Rain Chen


# Overview
Inspired by the classic “Catch the Fruit” game, Catch the Skule is customized to have a Skule-related theme. Use the arrow buttons on the PS2 keyboard that is connected to the DE1-SoC board to move the fruit basket left and right to catch items randomly dropped from the sky.

The graphical data should only be used for the project "Catch The Skule" in ECE243 at the University of Toronto, Canada. We are against any non-academic distributions of the graphical data , especially of commercial purpose.
